This API (Application Programming Interface) document has pages corresponding to the items in the navigation bar, described as follows.

* === Overview

The link:index.html[Overview] page is the front page of this API document and provides a list of all packages with a summary for each. This page can also contain an overall description of the set of packages.
* === Package

Each package has a page that contains a list of its classes and interfaces, with a summary for each. These pages may contain six categories:

** Interfaces
** Classes
** Enums
** Exceptions
** Errors
** Annotation Types
* === Class or Interface

Each class, interface, nested class and nested interface has its own separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of a class/interface description, summary tables, and detailed member descriptions:

** Class Inheritance Diagram
** Direct Subclasses
** All Known Subinterfaces
** All Known Implementing Classes
** Class or Interface Declaration
** Class or Interface Description

 +

** Nested Class Summary
** Field Summary
** Property Summary
** Constructor Summary
** Method Summary

 +

** Field Detail
** Property Detail
** Constructor Detail
** Method Detail

Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed description for that item. The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they appear in the source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the programmer.
* === Annotation Type

Each annotation type has its own separate page with the following sections:

** Annotation Type Declaration
** Annotation Type Description
** Required Element Summary
** Optional Element Summary
** Element Detail
* === Enum

Each enum has its own separate page with the following sections:

** Enum Declaration
** Enum Description
** Enum Constant Summary
** Enum Constant Detail
* === Use

Each documented package, class and interface has its own Use page. This page describes what packages, classes, methods, constructors and fields use any part of the given class or package. Given a class or interface A, its "Use" page includes subclasses of A, fields declared as A, methods that return A, and methods and constructors with parameters of type A. You can access this page by first going to the package, class or interface, then clicking on the "Use" link in the navigation bar.
* === Tree (Class Hierarchy)

There is a link:overview-tree.html[Class Hierarchy] page for all packages, plus a hierarchy for each package. Each hierarchy page contains a list of classes and a list of interfaces. Classes are organized by inheritance structure starting with `java.lang.Object`. Interfaces do not inherit from `java.lang.Object`.

** When viewing the Overview page, clicking on "Tree" displays the hierarchy for all packages.
** When viewing a particular package, class or interface page, clicking on "Tree" displays the hierarchy for only that package.
* === Deprecated API

The link:deprecated-list.html[Deprecated API] page lists all of the API that have been deprecated. A deprecated API is not recommended for use, generally due to improvements, and a replacement API is usually given. Deprecated APIs may be removed in future implementations.
* === Index

The link:index-all.html[Index] contains an alphabetic index of all classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields, as well as lists of all packages and all classes.
* === All Classes

The link:allclasses.html[All Classes] link shows all classes and interfaces except non-static nested types.
* === Serialized Form

Each serializable or externalizable class has a description of its serialization fields and methods. This information is of interest to re-implementors, not to developers using the API. While there is no link in the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going to any serialized class and clicking "Serialized Form" in the "See also" section of the class description.
* === Constant Field Values

The link:constant-values.html[Constant Field Values] page lists the static final fields and their values.
* === Search

You can search for definitions of modules, packages, types, fields, methods and other terms defined in the API, using some or all of the name. "Camel-case" abbreviations are supported: for example, "InpStr" will find "InputStream" and "InputStreamReader".
